First We Will Prepare The Batter Of The Cake. Before Making The Batter First We Will Take A KARHAI And Put A stand In It And Let It Heat On Low-Medium Flame For 10-12 Minutes.
So,First We Will Take A Bowl.
We Will Add 1/2 Cup Grinded Sugar In The Bowl (100gm)
Then We Have To Add 1/2 Cup Fresh Curd In It.(125ml) (Milk Can Also Be Used Instead Of Curd)
Mix It Till The Sugar Dissolves In The Mixture.
Now Add 1/4 Cup Of Melted Butter To The Mixture. (60ml).
Now Add 1/4 TableSpoon Vanilla Essence. If We Don't Have Vanilla Essence Then We Can Skip This Step.
Now We Will Add All The Dry Ingredients To The MIxture.
We Will Add The Dry The Dry Ingredients By Seiving Them.
Take A Sieve.
Add 3/4 Cup All Purpose Flour (Maida) (100gm) , 2 Spoon Cocoa Powder , 1/4 TableSpoon Baking Soda , 3/4 TableSpoon Baking Powder In The Sieve And Sieve The Dry Ingredients In The Wet Mixture We Prepared Before, Sieving These Items Make The Air Mix Into Them And Make The Mixture Lighter.
Now Mix All The Wet And Dry Ingredients Slowly And Nicely.
Now Our Batter Is Ready.
Now Take A Cake Tin Or Any Other Suitable Utensil In Which We Can Bake The Cake. 
Apply Oil Or Butter Inside the Cake Tin And Put A Butter Paper In It Then Again Apply Oil Or Butter On The Butter Paper.If We Don't Have A Butter Paper Then We Can Also Use All Purpose Flour (Maida) In The cake Tin And Spread The All Purpose Flour Everywhere In the Cake Tin.
Now Pour The Batter In The Cake Tin And Tap It Well.
Now Put The Cake Tin On The Stand Which We Preheated At The Beginning.
Cover It With A Lid And Let the Cake Bake for 30-40 Minutes On Low-Medium Flame.
After 40 Minutes Check The Cake If It Is Baked. 
For Checking That Put A Toothpick In The Middle Of The Cake And Put It Out If The Batter Sticks To The Toothpick Then Let It Bake For More 10 Minutes. If It Dosen't Sticks Then The Cake Is Ready.
Now Let The Cake Cool For 10-15 Minutes.
Then Apply A knife From The Edge Of The Cake And Then Place A plate On The Tin And Move It Upside Down And Tap from Bottom The Cake will Come Out Of The Tin And Then Your Spongy Cake Is Ready.
